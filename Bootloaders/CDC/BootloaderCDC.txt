 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a CDC Class device (virtual serial port), allowing for AVR109
 *  protocol compatible programming software to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the AT90USB1287 with an 8KB bootloader section size, and will fit
 *  into 4KB of bootloader space. If you wish to alter this size and/or change the AVR model, you will need to
 *  edit the MCU, FLASH_SIZE_KB and BOOT_SECTION_SIZE_KB values in the accompanying makefile.
 *
 *  When the bootloader is running, the board's LED(s) will flash at regular intervals to distinguish the
 *  bootloader from the normal user application.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Driver Installation
 *
 *  After running this bootloader for the first time on a new computer, you will need to supply the .INF
 *  file located in this bootloader project's directory as the device's driver when running under Windows.
 *  This will enable Windows to use its inbuilt CDC drivers, negating the need for custom drivers for the
 *  device. Other Operating Systems should automatically use their own inbuilt CDC-ACM drivers.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HostApp Host Controller Application
 *
 *  This bootloader is compatible with the open source application AVRDUDE, Atmel's AVRPROG, or other
 *  applications implementing the AVR109 protocol, which is documented on the Atmel website as an application
 *  note.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_AVRDude AVRDUDE (Windows, Mac, Linux)
 *
 *  AVRDude is a free, cross-platform and open source command line programmer for Atmel and third party AVR
 *  programmers. It is available on the the Windows platform as part of the "WinAVR" package, or on other systems
 *  either from a build from the official source code, or in many distributions as a precompiled binary package.
 *
 *  To load a new HEX file with AVRDude, specify "AVR109" as the programmer, with the allocated COM port. On Windows
 *  platforms this will be a COMx port name:
 *  \code
 *  avrdude -c AVR109 -p at90usb1287 -P COM0 -U flash:w:Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  On Linux systems, this will typically be a /dev/ttyACMx port name:
 *  \code
 *  avrdude -c AVR109 -p at90usb1287 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:w:Mouse.hex
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  Refer to the AVRDude project documentation for additional usage instructions.
 *
 *  \section Sec_API User Application API
 *
 *  Several user application functions for FLASH and other special memory area manipulations are exposed by the bootloader,
 *  allowing the user application to call into the bootloader at runtime to read and write FLASH data.
 *
 *  By default, the bootloader API jump table is located 32 bytes from the end of the device's FLASH memory, and follows the
 *  following layout:
 *
 *  \code
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE          32
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START         ((FLASHEND + 1UL) - BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE)
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(Index)         (void*)((BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (Index * 2)) / 2)
 *
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_ErasePage)(uint32_t Address)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(0);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_WritePage)(uint32_t Address)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(1);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_FillWord)(uint32_t Address, uint16_t Word) = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(2);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadSignature)(uint16_t Address)           = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(3);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadFuse)(uint16_t Address)                = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(4);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadLock)(void)                            = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(5);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_WriteLock)(uint8_t LockBits)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(6);
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE_START   (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 2))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE         0xDCFB
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_CLASS_SIGNATURE_START   (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 4))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_CDC_SIGNATURE           0xDF00
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_START           (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 8))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_LENGTH          4
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  From the application the API support of the bootloader can be detected by reading the FLASH memory bytes located at address
 *  \c BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE_START and comparing them to the value \c BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE. The class of bootloader
 *  can be determined by reading the FLASH memory bytes located at address \c BOOTLOADER_CLASS_SIGNATURE_START and comparing them
 *  to the value \c BOOTLOADER_CDC_SIGNATURE. The start address of the bootloader can be retrieved by reading the bytes of FLASH
 *  memory starting from address \c BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_START.
 *
 *  \subsection SSec_API_MemLayout Device Memory Map
 *  The following illustration indicates the final memory map of the device when loaded with the bootloader.
