 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  This bootloader enumerates to the host as a Mass Storage device, capable of reading and writing a new binary
 *  firmware image file, to load firmware onto the AVR.
 *
 *  Out of the box this bootloader builds for the AT90USB1287 with an 8KB bootloader section size, and will fit
 *  into 8KB of bootloader space. If you wish to alter this size and/or change the AVR model, you will need to
 *  edit the MCU, FLASH_SIZE_KB and BOOT_SECTION_SIZE_KB values in the accompanying makefile.
 *
 *  When the bootloader is running, the board's LED(s) will flash at regular intervals to distinguish the
 *  bootloader from the normal user application.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Installation Driver Installation
 *
 *  This bootloader uses the Mass Storage drivers inbuilt into all modern operating systems, thus no additional
 *  drivers need to be supplied for correct operation.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HostApp Host Controller Application
 *
 *  This bootloader is compatible with all operating systems that support the FAT12 file system format. To reprogram the
 *  device, overwrite a file stored on the virtual FAT filesystem with a new binary (BIN format) image. Remember to safely
 *  remove your device from the host using the host OS's ejection APIs, to ensure all data is correctly flushed to the
 *  bootloader's virtual filesystem and not cached in the OS's file system driver.
 *
 *  The current device firmware can be read from the device by reading a file from the virtual FAT filesystem.
 *
 *  \section Sec_API User Application API
 *
 *  Several user application functions for FLASH and other special memory area manipulations are exposed by the bootloader,
 *  allowing the user application to call into the bootloader at runtime to read and write FLASH data.
 *
 *  By default, the bootloader API jump table is located 32 bytes from the end of the device's FLASH memory, and follows the
 *  following layout:
 *
 *  \code
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE          32
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START         ((FLASHEND + 1UL) - BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE)
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(Index)         (void*)((BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (Index * 2)) / 2)
 *
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_ErasePage)(uint32_t Address)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(0);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_WritePage)(uint32_t Address)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(1);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_FillWord)(uint32_t Address, uint16_t Word) = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(2);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadSignature)(uint16_t Address)           = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(3);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadFuse)(uint16_t Address)                = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(4);
 *  uint8_t (*BootloaderAPI_ReadLock)(void)                            = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(5);
 *  void    (*BootloaderAPI_WriteLock)(uint8_t LockBits)               = BOOTLOADER_API_CALL(6);
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE_START   (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 2))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE         0xDCFB
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_CLASS_SIGNATURE_START   (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 4))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_MASS_STORAGE_SIGNATURE  0xDF30
 *
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_START           (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_START + (BOOTLOADER_API_TABLE_SIZE - 8))
 *  #define BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_LENGTH          4
 *  \endcode

 *  The following illustration indicates the final memory map of the device when loaded with the bootloader.

 *
 *  Bootloaders reporting a device release revision number of 1.00 or greater are bootloader API enabled. From the application
 *  the API support of the bootloader can be detected by reading the FLASH memory bytes located at address \c BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE_START
 *  and comparing them to the value \c BOOTLOADER_MAGIC_SIGNATURE. The class of bootloader can be determined by reading the
 *  FLASH memory bytes located at address \c BOOTLOADER_CLASS_SIGNATURE_START and comparing them to the value \c BOOTLOADER_MASS_STORAGE_SIGNATURE.
 *  The start address of the bootloader can be retrieved by reading the bytes of FLASH memory starting from address \c BOOTLOADER_ADDRESS_START.
