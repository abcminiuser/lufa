 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Remote Network Driver Interface demonstration application.
 *  This gives a simple reference application for implementing
 *  a CDC RNDIS device acting as a simple network interface for
 *  ethernet packet exchange. RNDIS is a proprietary Microsoft
 *  standard; this demo will only work on Windows XP, or on modern
 *  Linux kernels.
 *
 *  Before running, you will need to install the INF file that
 *  is located in the RNDISEthernet project directory. This will
 *  enable Windows to use its inbuilt RNDIS drivers, negating the
 *  need for special Windows drivers for the device. To install,
 *  right-click the .INF file and choose the Install option. If
 *  Windows 2000 is used, the Microsoft INF file in the hotfix
 *  will need to be altered to use the VID/PID of the demo and
 *  then chosen instead of the LUFA RNDIS INF file when prompted.
 *
 *  When enumerated, this demo will install as a new network
 *  adapter which ethernet packets can be sent to and received
 *  from. When packets are received from the host, the on-board LEDs should
 *  flash.
 *
 *  \section Sec_Options Project Options
