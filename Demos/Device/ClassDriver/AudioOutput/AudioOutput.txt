 *  \section Sec_Description Project Description:
 *
 *  Audio demonstration application. This gives a simple reference
 *  application for implementing a USB Audio Output device using the
 *  basic USB Audio 1.0 drivers in all modern OSes (i.e. no special drivers
 *  required).
 *
 *  On start-up the system will automatically enumerate and function
 *  as a USB speaker. Outgoing audio will output in 8-bit PWM onto
 *  the timer 3 channels A and B for AVR8 devices, and through PWM outputs
 *  specific for each UC3 board. Audio output will also be indicated on
 *  the board LEDs. Decouple audio outputs with a capacitor and attach to a
 *  speaker to hear the audio.
 *
 *  Under Windows, if a driver request dialogue pops up, select the option
 *  to automatically install the appropriate drivers.
 *
