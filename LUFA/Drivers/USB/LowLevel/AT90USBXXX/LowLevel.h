			 *  As the USB library relies on USB interrupts for some of its functionality, this routine will

			 *
			 *  Calling this function when the USB interface is already initialized will cause a complete USB

			 *
			 *  \param Mode     This is a mask indicating what mode the USB interface is to be initialized to.
			 *                  Valid mode masks are USB_MODE_DEVICE, USB_MODE_HOST or USB_MODE_UID.
			 *
			 *  \param Options  Mask indicating the options which should be used when initializing the USB
			 *                  interface to control the USB interface's behaviour. This should be comprised of
			 *                  a USB_OPT_REG_* mask to control the regulator, a USB_OPT_*_PLL mask to control the
			 *                  PLL, and a USB_DEVICE_OPT_* mask (when the device mode is enabled) to set the device
			 *                  mode speed.
			 *
			 *  \note To reduce the FLASH requirements of the library if only device or host mode is required, 
			 *        this can be statically set via defining the token USB_DEVICE_ONLY for device mode or 
			 *        USB_HOST_ONLY for host mode in the use project makefile, passing the token to the compiler 
			 *        via the -D switch. If the mode is statically set, this parameter does not exist in the
			 *        function prototype.
			 *
			 *  \note To reduce the FLASH requirements of the library if only fixed settings are are required,
			 *        the options may be set statically in the same manner as the mode (see the Mode parameter of 
			 *        this function). To statically set the USB options, pass in the USE_STATIC_OPTIONS token,
			 *        defined to the appropriate options masks. When the options are statically set, this
			 *        parameter does not exist in the function prototype.
			 *        
			 *  \note The mode parameter does not exist on devices where only one mode is possible, such as USB 
			 *        AVR models which only implement the USB device mode in hardware.
