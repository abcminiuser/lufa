			/** Creates a prototype for or begins a stream callback routine. Stream callback routines are small
			 *  routines which are executed during stream read or writes (if the callback-enabled versions of
			 *  these functions are used) which allow the user application to abort the transfer when certain
			 *  arbitrary conditions are met.
			 *
			 *  Stream callback functions should return a value from the StreamCallback_Return_ErrorCodes_t
			 *  enum.
			 *
			 *  Usage Example (Device Endpoint, but applicable for Host pipes also):
			 *  \code
			 *  STREAM_CALLBACK(GlobalNotSet); // Callback Prototype
			 *
			 *  STREAM_CALLBACK(GlobalNotSet)
			 *  {
			 *     if (MyGlobal == false)
			 *         return ENDPOINT_STREAMCALLBACK_Continue;
			 *     else
			 *         return ENDPOINT_STREAMCALLBACK_Abort;
			 *  }
			 *
			 *  //...
			 *  // Inside some routine:
			 *  if (Endpoint_Write_CStream_LE(DataBuffer, sizeof(DataBuffer), GlobalNotSet) == 
			 *                                ENDPOINT_RWSTREAM_ERROR_CallbackAborted)
