/** Library events module. This module contains macros and functions relating to the management of library
 *  events, which are small pieces of code similar to ISRs which are run when a given condition is met. Each
 *  event can be fired from multiple places in the user or library code, which may or may not be inside an ISR,
 *  thus each handler should be written to be as small and fast as possible to prevent possible problems.
 *
 *  Events can be hooked by the user application using the EVENT_HANDLER() and HANDLES_EVENT() macros. If an
 *  event with no associated handler is fired within the library, it by default fires an internal empty stub
 *  function. This is achieved through the use of the GCC compiler's "alias" attribute.
 *
 *  Each event must only have one associated event handler, but can be raised by multiple sources.
