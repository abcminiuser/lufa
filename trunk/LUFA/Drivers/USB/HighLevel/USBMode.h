/** \file
 *  \brief USB mode and capability macros.
 *
 *  This file defines macros indicating the type of USB controller the library is being compiled for, and its
 *  capabilities. These macros may then be referenced in the user application to selectively enable or disable
 *  code sections depending on if they are defined or not.
 *
 *  \note This file should not be included directly. It is automatically included as needed by the USB driver
 *        dispatch header located in LUFA/Drivers/USB/USB.h.

/** \ingroup Group_USB
 *  @defgroup Group_USBMode USB Mode Tokens
 *
 *  After the inclusion of the master USB driver header, one or more of the following
 *  tokens may be defined, to allow the user code to conditionally enable or disable
 *  code based on the USB controller family and allowable USB modes. These tokens may
 *  be tested against to eliminate code relating to a USB mode which is not enabled for
 *  the given compilation.
