/** \file
 *  \brief Master include file for the board LEDs driver.
 *
 *  This file is the master dispatch header file for the board-specific LED driver, for boards containing user
 *  controllable LEDs.
 *
 *  User code should include this file, which will in turn include the correct LED driver header file for the
 *  currently selected board.
 *
 *  If the BOARD value is set to BOARD_USER, this will include the /Board/LEDs.h file in the user project
 *  directory.
 *
 *  For possible BOARD makefile values, see \ref Group_BoardTypes.

 *
 *  \section Sec_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - None
 *
 *  \section Module Description
 *  Hardware LEDs driver. This provides an easy to use driver for the hardware LEDs present on many boards. It
 *  provides an interface to configure, test and change the status of all the board LEDs.
 *
 *  If the BOARD value is set to BOARD_USER, this will include the /Board/Dataflash.h file in the user project
 *  directory. Otherwise, it will include the appropriate built in board driver header file. If the BOARD value
 *  is set to BOARD_NONE, this driver is silently disabled.
 *
 *  For possible BOARD makefile values, see \ref Group_BoardTypes.
 *
 *  \note To make code as compatible as possible, it is assumed that all boards carry a minimum of four LEDs. If
 *        a board contains less than four LEDs, the remaining LED masks are defined to 0 so as to have no effect.
 *        If other behaviour is desired, either alias the remaining LED masks to existing LED masks via the -D
 *        switch in the project makefile, or alias them to nothing in the makefile to cause compilation errors when
 *        a non-existing LED is referenced in application code. Note that this means that it is possible to make
 *        compatible code for a board with no LEDs by making a board LED driver (see \ref Page_WritingBoardDrivers)
 *        which contains only stub functions and defines no LEDs.
