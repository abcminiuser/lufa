 *  User code should include this file, which will in turn include the correct joystick driver header file for the
 *  currently selected board.
 *
 *  If the BOARD value is set to BOARD_USER, this will include the /Board/Joystick.h file in the user project

 *  For possible BOARD makefile values, see \ref Group_BoardTypes.
